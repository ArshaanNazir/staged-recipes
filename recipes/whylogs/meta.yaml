  description: |
    Whylogs is an open source library for logging any kind of data. 
    With whylogs, users are able to generate summaries of their 
    datasets (called _whylogs profiles_) which they can use to:

    1. Track changes in their dataset
    2. Create _data constraints_ to know whether their data looks the way it should
    3. Quickly visualize key summary statistics about their datasets
